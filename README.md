# Kenya Census (2019) Insights
## The goal of this project is to generate insightful visualizations from the Kenya Population and Housing Census (2019)

### Visualization 1 - Kenyan Generations (2019)
In this visualization, I look at the Total Kenyan Population by Generation. 
Here, Kenyans are classified into 5 generations (Pre-Independence, Kenyatta I, Moi, Kibaki, and Kenyatta II)
