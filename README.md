# Kenya Census (2019) Insights
## The goal of this project is to generate visualizations from the Kenya Population and Housing Census (2019)

### Project 1 - Car Ownership in Kenya (2019)

In this section we determine the percentage of Kenyan households that own a car. 
The visualization shows the percentage of households that own a car in each of the 47 counties. 
This is also compared to the urban, rural, and national averages. 
As expected (due to various economic and lifestyle factors), Nairobi and its neighboring counties have higher percentages of households that own cars.
